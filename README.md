sublime-unity
=====================

This script creates and synchronizes a Sublime Text project from a Unity project.

Synchronization is automatic and happens after every compile.

Synchronization can also be done manually through the menu command Assets > Sync Sublime Text Project

Tips
---

* If you are using Sublime Text 2, make sure to change the file paths referenced.
* Make sure to set Unity to open Sublime Text as the default script editor. In Windows, you will need to wrap sublime_text.exe in order to open a file at a line number. Check the blog post linked below for more information.
* Check out my ST3 packages and configuration here: <http://github.com/jcmontoute/sublime-text-packages>
