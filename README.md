sublime-unity
=====================

*Note: I don't really use this anymore, but I'm leaving it up for anyone who finds it useful.*

This script creates and synchronizes a Sublime Text project from a Unity project.

Synchronization is automatic and happens after every compile.

Synchronization can also be done manually through the menu command **Assets > Sync Sublime Text Project**.

Make sure to set Unity to open Sublime Text as the default script editor. In Windows, you will need to wrap sublime_text.exe in order to open a file at a line number. Check the blog post linked below for more information.
